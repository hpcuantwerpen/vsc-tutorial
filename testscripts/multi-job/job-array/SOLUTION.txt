# Examples for array jobs via Torque and Worker
#
# Launch the Torque array job:
# qsub -t 1-100 torque_job_array.pbs.sh
#
# Launch the worker array job:
# module load $VSC_INSTITTUE_CLUSTER/supported worker
# wsub -t 1-100 -batch worker_job_array.pbs.sh
#
# Note the difference in the resource specifications:
# - Torque array job: Resources for a single job of the array
# - Worker: Resources for the overall worker process, so all array jobs
#   together.
