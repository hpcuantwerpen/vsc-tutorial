Example for worker parameter sweep with a spreadsheet table as input.

* With atools and Slurm
  - Load the atools/slurm module as we need to determine the number of
    work items when submitting the job.
    module load calcua/supported atools/slurm
  - Launch the job as a Slurm array job, using atools arange to extract 
    the index range from the data file.
    sbatch --array $(arange --data data.csv) atools_weather.slurm.sh

* With atools and Torque
  - Load the atools/torque module as we need to determine the number of
    work items when submitting the job.
    module load calcua/supported atools/slurm
  - Launch the job as a Torque array job, using atools arange to extract 
    the index range from the data file.
    qsub -t $(arange --data data.csv) atools_weather.pbs.sh

* With worker on Torque clusters:
  - Load the worker module
    module load calcua/supported worker
  - Launch with wsub: 
    wsub -data data.csv -batch worker_weather.pbs.sh

* Differences between the approaches:
  - With atools, one file is generated per line in data.csv, though this can
    be solved with aggregation in the postprocessing. With worker, all output
    is already contained in a single file, worker_weather.pbs.sh.o<jobid>.
  - With atools there is a lot more manual work. There is also added flexibility
    though as work items can now also be parallel jobs.
  - With atools, resource requests are for processing a single data item. With
    worker, the resource request is for the complete worker job, so the total
    time worker will need and the amount of cores that worker can use for all
    jobs together.
