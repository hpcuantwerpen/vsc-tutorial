Extend the example: 
a.  A first job writes the number 10 to the file “sim1.txt”
b.  Job two executes after the first. It reads the number from “sim1.txt”, 
    multiplies it by 2 and writes it to “sim2.txt”
c.  To result of the second simulation, two different perturbations are applied: 
    add 1 and 2 to the number in sim2.txt, and the third “simulation” that starts
    from that perturbed value multiplies the result by 2 and writes it in a file
    with the name sim3_pert_<…>.txt with <…> the perturbation. 
Use dependent jobs to make sure that the second “simulation” runs after the first one 
and that both “simulations” for the perturbations can run concurrently and after the
second “simulation”.
