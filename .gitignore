# Only put files here that result from the build process etc., not files
# specific to a particular editor or IDE. The latter patterns should be defined
# either in a global .gitignore (git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore)
# or in .git/info/excludes on a per-repository basis.
# In doing so, the .gitignore in the repository remains independent of any
# particular IDE and remains relevant to all users of the repository.
