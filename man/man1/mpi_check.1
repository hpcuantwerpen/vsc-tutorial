.SH NAME
mpi_check \- Simple "Hello, World!"-style MPI program

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmpi_check\fR is a simple "Hello, World!"-style MPI program
that can print some information about where it is running.

Each rank prints a line with its MPI rank, the core
number and the node name it is running on.
The output is sorted according to the MPI rank. One can also label each call to \fBmpi_check\fR
which is great for
distinguishing between the output of different components of a
heterogeneous job, and information on the pinning of each process.

The MPI processes should be started using
\fBsrun\fR or \fBmpirun\fR with the appropriate options for your environment.
When started without \fBsrun\fR, the behaviour will depend on the configuration
of the system. On some systems it may fail to run and on other systems
it will just run a single instance of the program, in which case
it would actually show what a regular serial program would do.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Print help information about the command
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fI\,LABEL\/\fR
Label the output of this process with \fI\,LABEL\/\fR. This automatically
enables displaying labels.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR \fI\,TIME\/\fR
keeps all allocated CPUs busy for approximately \fI\,TIME\/\fR seconds
computing the surface of the Mandelbrot fractal with a naive
Monte Carlo algorithm so that a user can logon to the nodes
and see what is happening. At the end it will print the
allocation of the threads again as the OS may have improved
the spreading of the threads over the cores.
If different values are given for different parts in a
Slurm heterogeneous job, the largest will be used and applied to all
components of the heterogeneous job.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Show the NUMA affinity mask: Once ASCII character per virtual core,
where a number or capital letter denotes that the core can be used
and the number or letter denotes the NUMA group (or a * if the
number of the NUMA group would be 36 or larger) and a dot denotes
that the core is not used.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Numeric representation of the affinity mask as a series of core
or ranges of cores.

.PP
In a heterogeneous job, the \fB\-w\fR, \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-r\fR options need to be specified for
only one of the components of the job but will apply to all components.

.SH EXAMPLE

The following is a job script to start a heterogeneous job in Slurm that
shows many features of this program:

.EX
#! /bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=2:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=8 --cpus-per-task=1

srun mpi_check -l test -w 15 -n -r
.EE

This script simulates an MPI job running \fBmpi_check\fR labeled exe1 on
8 cores.
It will also simulate some load during
approximately 15 seconds, and before and after that print the distribution
of threads including the affinity in the two supported formats.
You may have to add the appropriate \fBmodule load\fR commands to the script
to ensure that \fBmpi_check\fR works, and the script also assumes that it
is in the search path for executables.
