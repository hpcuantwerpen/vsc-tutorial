.SH NAME
vsc-tutorial \- Various example programs for the hands-on tutorials at
UAntwerp.

.SH DESCRIPTION
vsc-tutorial contains various small programs that are used in the HPC hands-on
tutorials at UAntwerp, e.g., to start various types of programs.

Commands:
.TP
\fBserial_hello\fR
Simple program to test starting a (group of) serial program(s)

.TP
\fBomp_hello\fR
Simple program to test starting an OpenMP program

.TP
\fBmpi_hello\fR
Simple program to test starting a MPI program

.TP
\fBmpi_omp_hello\fR
Simple program to test starting a hybrid MPI/OpenMP program

.TP
\fBserial_check\fR
A variant of serial_hello, with
options to put some load on the allocated CPU and to print process affinity
in two different formats.

.TP
\fBomp_check\fR
A variant of omp_hello, with
options to put some load on the allocated CPUs and to print thread affinity
in two different formats.

.TP
\fBmpi_check\fR
A variant of mpi_hello, suitable to test heterogeneous jobs and with
options to put some load on the allocated CPUs and to print process affinity
in two different formats.

.TP
\fBmpi_omp_check\fR
A variant of mpi_omp_hello, suitable to test heterogeneous jobs and with
options to put some load on the allocated CPUs and to print thread affinity
in two different formats.

.TP
\fBeat_mem\fR
Single-threaded program that consumes a given amount of memory to test
memory allocations

.TP
\fBeat_cpu\fR
Single-threaded program that only serves to put some load on a CPU to
experiment with monitoring jobs

.TP
\fBeat_disk\fR
Single-threaded program that consumes a given amount of memory to test
memory allocations

.SH SEE ALSO
omp_hello(1), mpi_hello(1), mpi_omp_hello(1), mpi_omp_check(1), eat_mem(1), eat_cpu(1), eat_disk(1)
